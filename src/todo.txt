Complexity problems:

-> get_code_by_moving_block (code, i, j, k)
    : Need to do in O(1) complexity, but how?
    : Need to be done in a very efficient serialized manner?

    : Precomputation:
        Suppose for [code][i][j] (code and block)
            -> We store min (code) which leads to optimal answer for all k
            to which we can tranpose this block
            -> If found use the value,
            -> If not found, calculate for all
        -> Will reduce complexity to O(n!*(n) + n!*n^2)

        -> This will require another level of abstraction
