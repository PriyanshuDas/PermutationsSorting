    - Not really, let's proceed
-> Do pre-computation                                   [ ]
-> Create a pure permutation labels
    + generator
    + storage
    + retrieval
-> Store pure labels and construct struct/graphs        [ ]



----------------------------

Ideas:

-> We don't need to generate permutations,
    : Having Lehmer codes is good enough

-> We only need to maintain pre_compute for the current level of codes
    : Use Lehmer code, instead of permutation
    : Store the actual code though, to be able to find the
        : lower level adjacencies

-> If we can make it so that Lehmer code delta for the move
    : Move (p, i, j) be calculated in O(1), we get the following hypothetical complexities:
        Memory: O(n!*8)
        Time: O(n!*n^3)

        This is significantly reduced memory:
        > storing the final results
        > storing the reduced (lehmer code, size) for "unpure" lehmer codes

        Move (p, i, j) gives lehmer code of permutation obtained by
            moving jth element to after i, in the permutation represented by lehmer code p
